    "For the past year I've been keeping a spreadsheet of all the books I have read (including audiobooks). I had no plan for this record other than being able to remember what I had read. However, I am curious if there are any insights I can glean from this data that I otherwise might not have considered. Either way, it is an opportunity to practice cleaning and analyzing data using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Had I intended to use this dataset for later analysis, I might have set it up differently. Why did have two genre columns? Will that be useful or not? I can immediately see some things that will be tricky, such as the Author(s) column, which has multiple comma-separated values in at least one row. "

    "This is, after all, a list of books. Behind this table are the subjective experiences of reading words, of learning about new ideas, imagining characters, being surprised or amazed or annoyed. This data can't show that I read You Are a Badass at Making Money and 1: found the author's Ayn Rand-influenced perspective offputting, and 2: failed to manifest a fortune and retire before the age of 40 (yet). The data does not show that the only reason I read at least two of the books in the list (The Girl on the Train, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running) was that I found them on a free book cart outside my former office, and later wanted something not too difficult to read before going to sleep. It does not show that I really do want to finish Lincoln in the Bardo, but I borrowed it from the library and had to return it before reaching the end. It can't show how impressed I was by Carolyn Forche's haunting memoir of her time in El Salvador, What You Have Heard is True.\n",

    "There are also a number of things the data could have told me if I had set up the data structure differently at the start. I could have tracked when I started and finished each book and found the average time it took to read/listen (and if that was different for physical books and audiobooks). I could have created a value scale and rated each book. I could have included author gender to see if I'm reading an imbalance of male authors."
